# Vupiter Design Description
```

DC power supplies are easily one of the most important
pieces of test equipment in a lab while simultaneously 
being the most basic in concept. The focus of the 
Vupiter project will be to create a low-cost open-source 
versatile benchtop power supply. To make Vupiter versatile 
we will provide a computer interface that will allow 
power users to automate testing and data collection, in 
addition to the typical front-panel control. This 
computer interface will allow Vupiter to be useful in a 
much larger domain of experimentation than could be 
explored without a computer interface. Community expansion 
on this computer interface and the design as a whole 
will be enabled through thorough documentation at every 
stage. We will be documenting not just the technical 
details but also the decision making process along the way 
meaning Vupiter will be able to serve simultaneously as a
useful lab tool and as a teaching tool. This level of 
documentation is the critical element frequently missing 
from most open source hardware projects, even other 
open source supplies, that prevents them from becoming 
truly community projects.
