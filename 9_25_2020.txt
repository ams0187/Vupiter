* Where does it go when we are done? 
  SPARC Lab or person who would like the unit will
  reimburse team member full cost to build.

* Desired specs?
  - 3 Channels
    - 0 to 30v dc per channel
    - 5A per channel
  - 10 mV/mA resolution 
  - Dimensions = 200mm(W) x 150mm(H) x 300mm(D)

* Unit cost goal for prototype build?
  < $100

* Project funding?
  Split cost evenly between all members.

* Pretty front panel or rely on computer?
  Front panel user interface with screen, decide on 
  control buttons later.

* Mechanically modular?
  - No, a robust design for repeatable and reliable pin
    connections are outside of available time frame.
  - Use three channel hard configured ports.

* Standards to use.
  - SCPI standard for control.
  - Team members to research assigned areas and determine
    other standards when more design specs are knows.

* Project Constraints (needs further discussion)
  - economic - CHEAP BB
  - environmental - EFFICENCY
  - manufacturability - Well we made it didn't we?
  - health and safety - Radiated emissions? 

* Decisions are made by vote with ties decided by?
  In tie situation, team will discuss options and come to 
  agreement. If no agreement reached, team leader make 
  final decision.

* Discord will handle communication, meetings are Wednesday
  mornings at 9. Meetings will be recorded by hand and 
  posted on the website.

* SPARC lab and home shop are facilities to be used

* Gantt chart created with excel and to be stored on Auburn 
  BoxDrive for collaboration.
  - Task were assigned to each member
  - Rough draft of time frames created for task completion
